        <span className="font-bold italic">Popartganda</span> – The Popartganda series originated with a collection of digital concept works, including FEAR, UKIND, COMMUNICATION, BOUGHT SPACE, and FALLEN KINGS. Each piece serves as a visual and conceptual response to socio-political tensions, consumerism, and the contradictions embedded in modern life.

        A pivotal work within this series, FALLEN KINGS, was realized in Auckland following the artist’s relocation after the Christchurch earthquakes. While FEAR and UNKIND directly address the psychological and societal aftermath of the disaster, BOUGHT SPACE critiques the escalating housing crisis—where property values soared beyond accessibility, even in the wake of urgent need. The sharp irony that defines BK’s practice was unmistakable in these early works.
